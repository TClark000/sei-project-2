## General info
Trefle is a global botanical API, https://trefle.io  
It is an open sourced dataset with over 1 million plants.  To narrow the focus for this **Reactathon** project the focus was on **edible plants**.

## Screenshots

In the below image a search for garlic displays 2 edible plants from the family Amaryllidaceae.  Members of the family characteristically feature bulbs or underground stems and straplike leaves.
